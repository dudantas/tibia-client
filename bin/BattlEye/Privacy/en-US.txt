In order to serve its purpose of preventing and detecting the use of cheat software with the goal of ensuring a fair game environment, BattlEye may process the following information from you:

- IP address
- Game identifiers (e.g. in-game name, account ID, etc.)
- Hardware device information and identifiers (e.g. serial numbers)
- Information about the running operating system
- Information about game-related and operating-system-related files and memory
- Information about running processes, drivers and other executable code

BattlEye follows a data minimization policy that ensures that data is only being stored when necessary, i.e. when BattlEye finds information that may potentially indicate the use of cheat software. As a result, BattlEye generally will not store any information on most users.

BattlEye may store the information for the entire duration of the provision of its services for the game.
